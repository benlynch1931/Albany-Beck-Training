# Things to consider for quality code 

1. Decompose code
   - Use lots of smaller methods
   - We are writing for other developers on the team as well
   - Easier and purer for Unit Testing as methods do exactly **one** thing.

2. Naming Conventions
   - Reference names talk about something specific 


3. Method Documentation

4. Declarative Code
   - Links to `1`
   - Hide the logic in separate file/methods
   - Only show **what** you want, and not **how** you're getting it

5. Directory and File Architecture 
   - How the classes and files are laid out
