## Translators in Java

Java uses both compilers and interpreters to execute code and programs

### Compilers (JDK - Java Delevoper Kit)
- Compiles Java source code into ByteCode (Intermediate Code)
- Provides portability in Java
- Much easier to export code

  
### Interpreter (JRE/JVM)
  - Interprets ByteCode line-by-line
  - Only shows 1 Runtime Error at a time
  - Can be on a separate machine
