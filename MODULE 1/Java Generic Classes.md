# Generic Classes

Generic Types or Generic Classes are parameterized over types.



One of the best things about Java is it's Type-Safety. Meaning you must declare the
variable with a data type before assigning a value. This variable is now locked in to 
that specific data type.

Generic Classes can be used for Type-Safety, requiring the code to provide a datatype specific to the newly instantiated object.
